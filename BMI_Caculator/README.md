BMI_Caculator

This code is a simple BMI calculator that takes the user's weight in pounds and height in inches as input, and then calculates the BMI and prints the category and description for the user. The code also includes a disclaimer that BMI is not a perfect measure of health, and that it should be used in conjunction with other factors, such as waist circumference and blood pressure.

The code is written in Python, and it is well-commented, so it is easy to understand and modify. The code is also modular, so it is easy to reuse the different functions in other projects.
