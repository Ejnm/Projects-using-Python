# Python

This project is a collection of my Python practices. I am an entry-level data analyst with a passion for using data to solve problems. I have been learning Python for the past year, and I have completed a number of projects using the language.

The projects in this repository showcase my skills in data manipulation and cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, web scraping, and working with databases. I have used a variety of Python libraries and modules, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Beautiful Soup.
